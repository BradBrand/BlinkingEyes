ATTiny45 C code for the Make Project Blinking Eyes

The Makefile is made for Mac OS X.  Some changes may need to be
made for Windows or Linux.  The following commands compile and
install the code:

To compile: 
make all

To install:
make install

The files are commented fairly liberally.  Thanks to Windell H.

their great projects from which I stole, er learned a lot.
